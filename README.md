Digitalization of Hospital system

Features
Online Appointment Booking: Patients can easily register and schedule appointments with their preferred doctors online. The system provides a user-friendly interface with date and time availability, enabling patients to choose the most convenient slots.

Doctor and Patient Profiles: Doctors and patients have dedicated profiles where they can manage personal information, view appointments, and access relevant details. Doctors can update their availability and view patient medical histories, while patients can track their upcoming and past appointments.

Database Connection

Import the database file (oh.sql) into your preferred database management system. This file contains the necessary SQL commands to create and populate the database.

Configure Database Connection: Open the dbconnection.php file in the project's root directory. Update the database connection details (host, port, username, password) to match your database configuration.
